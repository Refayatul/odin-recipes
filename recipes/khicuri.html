    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>What is kitchari?
        Kitchari is a porridge-like mixture of Basmati rice and yellow moong dal (split mung beans) simmered in spices such as turmeric, cumin seeds, ginger, and black pepper.
        
        It's one of the most basic staples in Ayurveda and has a texture similar to oatmeal. It can be enjoyed at any time of the day, however, it's most often enjoyed for lunch or dinner as a main dish.</p>
